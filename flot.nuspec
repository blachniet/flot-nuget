### Changes ###

- Updated example code to avoid encouraging unnecessary re-plots.
  (patch by soenter, pull request #1221)

### Bug fixes ###

 - Added a work-around to disable the allocation of extra space for first and
   last axis ticks, allowing plots to span the full width of their container.
   A proper solution for this bug will be implemented in the 0.9 release.
   (reported by Josh Pigford and andig, issue #1212, pull request #1290)

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.1, where the last tick label would
   sometimes wrap rather than extending the plot's offset to create space.
   (reported by Elite Gamer, issue #1283)

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.2, where the resize plugin would use
   unexpectedly high amounts of CPU even when idle.
   (reported by tommie, issue #1277, pull request #1289)

 - Fixed the selection example to work with jQuery 1.9.x and later.
   (reported by EGLadona and dmfalke, issue #1250, pull request #1285)

 - Added a detach shim to fix support for jQuery versions earlier than 1.4.x.
   (reported by ngavard, issue #1240, pull request #1286)

 - Fixed a rare 'Uncaught TypeError' when using the resize plugin in IE 7/8.
   (reported by tleish, issue #1265, pull request #1289)

 - Fixed zoom constraints to apply only in the direction of the zoom.
   (patch by Neil Katin, issue #1204, pull request #1205)

 - Markings lines are no longer blurry when drawn on pixel boundaries.
   (reported by btccointicker and Rouillard, issue #1210)

 - Don't discard original pie data-series values when combining slices.
   (patch by Phil Tsarik, pull request #1238)

 - Fixed broken auto-scale behavior when using deprecated [x|y]2axis options.
   (reported by jorese, issue #1228, pull request #1284)

 - Exposed the dateGenerator function on the plot object, as it used to be
   before time-mode was moved into a separate plugin.
   (patch by Paolo Valleri, pull request #1028)

### NuGet Package Changes ###

 - Changed the NuGet package dependency on jQuery from 1.8.3 to 1.2.6
